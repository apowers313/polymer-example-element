## About
An example of all the different features of Polymer. This is really meant as a demonstration and a jumping off point for being able to tweak different features and see how they respond. It's also a good example for how to test different features of Polymer.

Trying to strip out all the functionality of the examples to create your own element would be a waste of time. This element was created using [open-element-template](https://github.com/apowers313/open-element-template), which includes all the functionality for build, test, documentation, etc. If you are looking to create your own element, that would be a better place to start.

Things that are demonstrated by this element:
* Setting default values of attributes
* Changing values of properties by setting them in HTML

If there are other demonstrations that you would like, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/apowers313/polymer-example-element/issues) or [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
